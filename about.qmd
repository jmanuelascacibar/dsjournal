Welcome to my blog, if this can be called blog :D

As I dive deeper into machine learning and deep learning, I've realized I need a space to process and reflect on what I'm learning. This blog is that space. I'll be writing about what I'm learning, what I'm building, and what I'm thinking about. So be warned, this is a work in progress. I'm learning as I go, so expect to see a lot of mistakes and a lot of learning. But that's the point, right? It won't be original or groundbreaking but it will be the resource that I can refer to when I've inevitably forgotten something. I'm sharing my journey publicly in the hopes that it might help others who are also learning, and to hold myself accountable to my own learning goals.

If you stumble upon and find it useful, that's great! If you find a mistake, please let me know. And if you need any help or guidance, I'm more than happy to assist.

So, welcome to my blog. I hope you find something useful.
