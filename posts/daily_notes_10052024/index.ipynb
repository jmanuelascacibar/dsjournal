    "#### 1. Order Statistics ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic))\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the k-th order statistic of a statistical sample is equal to its k-th smallest value. Together with rank statistics, order statistics are among the most fundamental tools in non-parametric statistics and inference. Important special cases are the minimum and maximum value of a sample. Together with [rank statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(statistics)), order statistics are among the most fundamental tools in non-parametric statistics and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order statistic is always the minimum of the sample. It's denoted by $X_{(1)} = \\min\\{X_{1}, ..., X_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for a sample size n, the largest order statistic is the maximum, denoted by $X_{(n)} = \\max\\{X_{1}, ..., X_{n}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample range is the difference between the maximum and minimum order statistics: $R = X_{(n)} - X_{(1)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar is the interquantile range, which is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, denoted by $IQR = X_{(0.75n)} - X_{(0.25n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample median may or may not be an order statistic, since there is a single middle value only when the number n of observations is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[A most simple an beautiful explanation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderStatistic.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sample of $n$ variates $X_{1}, ..., X_{n}$, reorder them so that $Y_{1} < Y_{2} < ... < Y_{N}$. Then $Y_{i}$ is called the $i^{th}$ oder statistic, sometimes also denote by $X_{(i)}$.\n"
