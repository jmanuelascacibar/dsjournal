    "#### 1. Render Jupyter Notebooks with Quarto\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarto can render Jupyter Notebooks, which is a great feature. The ideal workflow is to use `quarto preview` to get a preview of the notebook and the `quarto render` to render the notebook to a different format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\t\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "quarto preview notebook.ipynb\n",
    "```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "You can preview in different formats, like HTML, PDF, or Docx.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "quarto preview notebook.ipynb --to pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can render without preview \n",
    "    \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "quarto render notebook.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Quarto first block `raw`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block in a Quarto document is the `raw` block. It is used to specify the document format, title, and author. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Add table of content to your document\n",
    "You can use the `toc` option to automatically generated table of content in the output document. You can also specify the number of levels using `toc-depth` option. `toc-expand` option can be used to expand the table of content. You can also use `toc-title` to specify the title of the table of content and specify the location using `toc-location`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Converting a Jupyter Notebook to Quarto\n",
    "You can convert a Jupyter Notebook to Quarto using the `quarto convert` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "quarto convert notebook.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. `PATH` in bash:\n",
    "The `PATH` is an environment variable that specifies a set of directories where executable programs are located. When you type a command in the terminal, the system searches through the directories specified in the `PATH` variable to find the executable program.\n",
    "This is like a python variable that lives in your shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to know from where your python is running, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "which python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to print the `PATH` variable, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Terminal\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. `~/.bashrc` file\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a shell configuration file that is executed when you start a new shell session. You can add environment variables, aliases, and other shell configurations to this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you can create the alias `ll` to list all files in a directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vim ~/.bashrc\n",
    "alias ll = 'ls -al'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. `source`  and `.` command\n",
    "\n",
    "In bash, the `source` command is used to execute commands from a file in the current shell session. Read the content of a file, which can be a script, a configuration file, or a file containing functions or aliases. Execute in the current shell environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot `.` command is a synonym for the `source` command as we've seen before with `~/.bashrc`. \n",
    "\n",
