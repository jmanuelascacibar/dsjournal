    "## 1. Installing Lightgbm GPU version (Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is to verify that your WSL version support GPU. You can check it by running `nvidia-smi` in the terminal. Second thing is to update your package list `sudo apt-get update`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step, we are going to check if OpenCL is installed in your system. You can check it by running `clinfo` in the terminal. If it is not installed, you can install it by running `sudo apt-get install clinfo`. Once you have installed OpenCL, we need to install OpenCL headers and libraries. You can do it by running `sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to check for Boost installation. You can check it by running `dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep 'Version'`. If it is not installed, you can install it by running `sudo apt install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to install CMake and GCC or Clang. You can install CMake by running `sudo apt install cmake`. For GCC, you can install it by running `sudo apt install gcc`. For Clang, you can install it by running `sudo apt install clang`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are ready to clone Lightgbm repository and build with GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM\n",
    "cd LightGBM\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "cd build\n",
    "```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to configure the build for GPU. You can do it by running `cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 ..`. Once the configuration is done, you can build Lightgbm by running `make -j4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Installing a new version of CMake\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is to download the latest version of CMake from the official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.23.1/cmake-3.23.1.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "Extract the source code\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tar -xzvf cmake-3.23.1.tar.gz\n",
    "cd cmake-3.23.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile CMake\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./bootstrap && make\n",
    "```\t\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an error because I didn't have OpenSSL Development package installed. You can install it by running `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`. After that, you can run `./bootstrap && make` again.make\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Install CMake\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
